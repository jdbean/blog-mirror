Let's take a look at my recent project SubReddit.
<!-- more -->
As I mentioned in my [last post](/rhymetime), I feel that working on small projects are an essential vehicle for learning and are especially so when approached with a clear intention. In this post I want to take a look at my recent project [SubReddit]https://github.com/jdbean/subreddit. SubReddit is a small single-page application built using the React framework. The application displays the a preview of the top posts from the film subreddit [r/analog](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog) and allows users to create a collection of favorite posts.

My intention in working on this project was to focus on building out styling from scratch. When starting up a new project it can be incredibly tempting (sometimes rightly so) to create an MVP using a well established frontend UI framework like [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and to add new styling or even override framework styling where your project calls for something unique or at least different. I've taken this approach using both Semantic UI and Bootstrap in prior projects and I felt it was leading me toward some bad habits; namely that I was becoming too dependent on struggling to fit a square peg into a round when sometimes it really make more sense to just build something from the ground up yourself. UI Frameworks can also add a lot of bulk to a site and tree shaking only the parts of the framework you need takes some time and effort to get set up.

I find that most people are much more comfortable *editing* the work of others than they are *producing* a rough draft. There is something incredibly intimidating about a blank page (or an empty file in this case) but I feel that coming to terms with the challenge of creating something completely new is a critical part of what it means to be a developer. That said, the day to day of software development often has little to do with building something completely from scratch. I often chuckle a little bit to myself when someone has a look at a project of mine and asks "wow, did you make all of that?". Even when the work is all my own, in a sense the answer is "no" because of the great debt I owe to the developers who built the foundational tools on which my work depends. I find, however, that when I practice building something on my own it often leaves me better equipped to adapting the work of others. In other words, through building out some SASS/CSS by hand or working directly with SVGs, not only do I practice desigining solutions with those technologies, but I am also better able to understand how to approach something like a frontend UI framework and adapt it to my needs in the future.
