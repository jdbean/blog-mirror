Over the past couple of weeks I've set out to become an active Free and Open Source software contributor.

As regular readers might recall, I've mentioned in some [recent](/rails-presenters) [posts](/rails-helpers) that I have been working in my free time to have some contributions merged. I'm pleased to say that I've managed to have a handful of my merge requests accepted and am going to use the post as an opportunity to reflect on the process.

I've spent the bulk of my professional life working with and for Free and Open Source Software projects. While I like to believe that my work made a significant contribution to those projects, I wasn't in a position to focus on making *technical* contributions until I began working in software development.

1. Working on a large-scale, sophisticated project;
2. Collaboration with experienced senior developers and other stake holders; and
3. Guarunteed production deployment of my code.

When it came time to pick a project to work on the choice was clear: [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com). GitLab is a really incredible project that offers a huge suite of options for DevOps: it handles source code management via git, code reviews, project management, documentation, and CI/CD.

GitLab is something that I rely on regularly. I've been running my own self-hosted installation of GitLab's Community Edition for nearly three years and am also a user of the free tier of its hosted service. My GitLab is used for all sorts of projects including this [website](/blogging-workflow)
